1. Had a bunch of trouble with OSDs not coming up (only 1 / 3 OSD deployment was actually created)
    Turns out this was the server rebooted and remapped drive labels (because now vega-drive is plugged in)
    Make sure tf/modules/rook/02-RookCluster/main.tf has drives that are actually mapped to the HDDs
    TODO: is there some way to check this? Maybe mount by guid or something

2. Having an issue where:
    - 66% of objects are "misplaced"
    - ceph says osds 1 and 2 are up but "out" -- running but not part of the cluster? Why?
