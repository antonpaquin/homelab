1. Had a bunch of trouble with OSDs not coming up (only 1 / 3 OSD deployment was actually created)
    Turns out this was the server rebooted and remapped drive labels (because now vega-drive is plugged in)
    Make sure tf/modules/rook/02-RookCluster/main.tf has drives that are actually mapped to the HDDs
    TODO: is there some way to check this? Maybe mount by guid or something

2. Having an issue where:
    - 66% of objects are "misplaced"
    - ceph says osds 1 and 2 are up but "out" -- running but not part of the cluster? Why?
    resolution: I just used "ceph osd in" (?) and it went fine

3. Ceph osds hog memory
    manually set resource mem limits to 4Gi and seems to be OK
    proxmox still reports super high but docker thinks its lower

4. Resize FS
    Works for me:
        1. resize PV in kubernetes (kubectl edit pv/...)
        2. resize PVC in kubernetes
        3. resize rbd in rook (rbd resize --pool rbd0-meta --name csi-vol-... --size=...)
        4. find rbd name 
            ssh into pod with mounted volume
            df -h
        5. ssh reimu-00
        6. sudo df -Th | grep <rbd name> to get mountpoint
        7. sudo xfs_growfs <mountpoint>
    (is it a bad thing that rbd pool is rbd0-meta?)
