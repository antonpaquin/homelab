Proxmox: set up as a cluster with one machine

Physical drives are set up as lvm disks (not thin -- thin allows overprovisioning space)

Set up one VM --
    (TODO: script this next time I do it)
    arch linux base image
    100Gi storage (possibly could be 200Gi?)
    All cpus, as much memory as fits (Something around 60Gi?), 2Gi reserved
        inode / dentry cache is going crazy here.
        Experiment: non-ballooning 48Gi to reimu-00 and 8Gi to hakurei?
    Install kubeadm plus whatever basic stuff is required to get started
    `kubeadm config images pull`
    Turn off machine and make it a template

From that template, two hosts -- hakurei, reimu-00
    reimu-00 also gets all the lvm volumes

~6 Nov 2022, had a kerfuffle where I pacman -Syuu'd and it upgraded k8s beyond the server version
    I used an old version from the pacman cache (/var/cache/pacman/pkg)
    It looks like things are pretty stable but maybe something pops up
    (Day later: upgrading to 1.25 anyway)

reimu-00: added archzfs repo from wiki (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unofficial_user_repositories#archzfs)
    proxmox can't drive passthrough through the gui
    use 
        ls -l /dev/disk/by-id
        sudo qm set 100 -scsi1 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST4000DM004-2CV104_ZTT13Y46
