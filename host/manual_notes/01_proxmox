Proxmox: set up as a cluster with one machine

Physical drives are set up as lvm disks (not thin -- thin allows overprovisioning space)

Set up one VM --
    (TODO: script this next time I do it)
    arch linux base image
    100Gi storage (possibly could be 200Gi?)
    All cpus, as much memory as fits (Something around 60Gi?), 2Gi reserved
        inode / dentry cache is going crazy here.
        Experiment: non-ballooning 48Gi to reimu-00 and 8Gi to hakurei?
    Install kubeadm plus whatever basic stuff is required to get started
    `kubeadm config images pull`
    Turn off machine and make it a template

From that template, two hosts -- hakurei, reimu-00
    reimu-00 also gets all the lvm volumes
