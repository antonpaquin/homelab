Proxmox: set up as a cluster with one machine

Physical drives are set up as lvm disks (not thin -- thin allows overprovisioning space)

Set up one VM --
    arch linux base image
    100Gi storage (possibly could be 200Gi?)
    All cpus, as much memory as fits (Something around 60Gi?), 2Gi reserved
    Install kubeadm plus whatever basic stuff is required to get started
    `kubeadm config images pull`
    Turn off machine and make it a template

From that template, two hosts -- hakurei, reimu-00
    reimu-00 also gets all the lvm volumes

hakurei:
    kubeadm init (see /k8s/control_plane/kubeadm_init.sh)
reimu-00:
    kubeadm join (output of kubeadm init)

Copy kubeconfig to opus
