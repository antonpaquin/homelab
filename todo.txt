ceph reliability
    Network change screwed ceph, in a way that I couldn't recover.
    I think rook keeps all its state in configmaps, so maybe I can dump all of them into rook/01-Restore and that will make things work?
    The subset I've got there now got decently far, but didn't manage to start OSDs. Maybe I need to dump the entire rook namespace?
