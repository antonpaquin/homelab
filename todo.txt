        web terminal emulator -- butterfly?
            possibly plus a bunch of built-in SSH
    Need to decide / spec:
        Image viewer
        some kind of notes server -- markdown?
        proxy?
        some kind of git? gitea?
        project management / ticketing / todo?
        elk?
        deepspeed / kubeflow
        background cycling extension for heimdall
            there's already a spot for this in the sidecar, just need to figure out an image source

ceph reliability
    Network change screwed ceph, in a way that I couldn't recover.
    I think rook keeps all its state in configmaps, so maybe I can dump all of them into rook/01-Restore and that will make things work?
    The subset I've got there now got decently far, but didn't manage to start OSDs. Maybe I need to dump the entire rook namespace?

opus: script a cron job to patch reimu-00 into resolv.conf
    I just tested, by-name doesn't work even if it's in /etc/hosts =( (dig: parse of /etc/resolv.conf failed)

SSO
    Bunch of passwords, standardized around 'cirno9ball' but that's not actually secure if this is ever exposed to the net
    TODO: SSO everything
    There are wrappers that let arbitrary passwordless login work, is there a way to disable passwords on those machines that require it?

nginx
    Current nginx is from  https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/
    TODO: use version from https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/
        helm?
    Apparently that has some nice stats exported to prometheus?

grafana
    container cron job?
        cadvisor does a decent job now but the per-pod name is ridiculous, I want more stats, and really things should be grouped by deployment anyway
        Maybe a cron job could aggregate something useful and stuff it back into prometheus?
        Not sure what's best practices here
    custom dashboards
        Because of the aforementioned pod name issue the legends are way too massive and shrink the usable graph space
        Could be fixed by moving things to show at the bottom instead of right, but that means editing dashboard json, and that means not using the gnet version
        Getting them via gnet id is nice because of the massive terraform diff problem but I had a mechanism to use locally saved json via terraform file()
